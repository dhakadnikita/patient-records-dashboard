# Patient Records Dashboard

A simple React (Vite) app demonstrating a Patient Records Dashboard with search, modal details, add patient form (local), and loading/error states.

## Features
- Landing page with header and navigation (Home / Patients / About)
- Patients page: fetches mock patient data from JSONPlaceholder and maps to patient cards
- Search bar to filter patients by name
- View Details modal for each patient
- Add New Patient (local state only)
- Loading and error states
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js >= 16

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```

## Deploy
You can deploy to Vercel or Netlify â€” connect the repo and set build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist`.
